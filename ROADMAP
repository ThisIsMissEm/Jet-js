== Road Map ==

This document outlines the objectives of each release of Jet.

1.3:
    First public release, contains basic functionality.

1.4:
    Restructure API to be more consistent and chainable

1.5:
    Jet.Require to autoloads files.
    
2.0:
    Realign library to focus more on Jet._base.js rather then the other utilities.
    Head towards possible class based / fully chainable / instance based code.
